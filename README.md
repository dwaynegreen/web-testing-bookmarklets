This is a forked version of web-testing-bookmarklets that James Bach created here: https://github.com/satisfice/web-testing-bookmarklets

# web-testing-bookmarklets
This is a set of bookmarklets I use for analyzing web applications for testing purposes.

## Installation

Copy and paste the code for each bookmarklet into the body of a corresponding bookmark that you create in your browser.

## Usage

Go to any web page and run any of these bookmarklets by selecting the bookmark that you've set up for it.

- Get DOM: grabs the entire DOM and collates it by tag name (i.e. all the form objects will be listed together).
- Get DOM URIs: Lists every URI that it can find in the document, including links, image sources, iframes, etc.
- Get DOM Classes: Lists every class in the DOM, collated by tag name.
- Get DOM Hidden: Lists every element of the DOM that has a style attribute that includes "hidden" or "display:none"
- Get DOM IDs: Lists every element of the DOM that has an ID, collated by tag name.
- Get DOM Innertext: Lists all the text associated with each element of the DOM.
- Get DOM Read/Write: Lists all the editable elements on the page.
- Get Storage: Dumps the contents of Javascript-visible cookies, Local Storage, and Session Storage
